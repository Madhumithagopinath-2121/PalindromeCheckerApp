//I USED JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO WRITE THIS CODE -UC5
//To check whether a string is a palindrome using the Stack data structure.
//This program uses a stack to reverse the characters of a string. Each character of the input string is pushed into the stack. Since a stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, popping elements from the stack produces the reversed string.
//The reversed string is then compared with the original string to determine whether it is a palindrome.
