# PalindromeCheckerApp
//I USED JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO WRITE THIS CODE -UC3
//To check whether a given string is a palindrome by converting the string into a character array and comparing characters using the two-pointer technique.
//This program demonstrates palindrome validation using a character array. The string is converted into an array of characters, and characters from both ends are compared until the center is reached.
//If all characters match, the string is identified as a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
//Accept or define an input string.
//Convert the string into a char[] using toCharArray().
//Initialize two pointers:
//left → start of array
//right → end of array
//Compare characters at both positions.
//Move pointers toward the center.
//Display whether the string is a palindrome.
